###### Edit the script so it changes to your own btc address

Go to https://github.com/g2aexploit/fake-g2a-timezone-glitch/blob/main/script.js

Copy the script, save it in your notepad or just download it

use CTRL+F 

Search for "your_btc_address"

**There are 2x "your_btc_address" to replace in the script**

![There will be 2 results that u have to change to your bitcoin address](https://i.imgur.com/eqXS76z.png)

Replace all 2 results with your bech32 bitcoin address (the one that starts with bc1) - It's important that your address starts with bc1 (bech32 type of address) because the script checks for the length of the address. If your address isn't exactly 42 characters long - just like bech32 addresses, the script's interval will never stop which causes problems with copying the script for the user as the value gets refreshed every 200 milliseconds 

Remember to check on g2a if the script is working and changing btc address to your own + qr code to your own (if it's not, then you did something wrong)
